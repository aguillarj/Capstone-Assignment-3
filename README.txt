My Submission-

The portion of the assignment 3 deliverables that answers the questions as per your outlined format can be seen in the file Assignment 3 Report.  There I report the results and discuss the outcomes for the models I used.  

Code- 
I've included all of my code in individual files in the code folder.  All of my work was done with python in Jupyter Notebooks.  If you don't have Jupyter Notebooks I've also included all of the code in a word document. Or you can use this link to a git hub repo: https://github.com/aguillarj/Capstone-Assignment-3 

Clicking on the .docx files will download them but clicking on the files in my code folder will open the file and display their output for you so you don't have to read a long document.  If it fails to load properly just click 'reload' and it should come up.

The Data- 
The data was taken from UCI's database for machine learning datasets.  The link is provided in the report.  In the Graphics document I generated some visuals to help get a fel for what the data contains and identify some trends.
